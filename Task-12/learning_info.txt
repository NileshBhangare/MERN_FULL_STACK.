HashSet:
Faster operations like add, remove, contains, size, etc.
It allows null element.
It is non-synchronized.
HashSet maintains no order.

LinkedHashSet:
Maintains the insertion order.
It allows null element.
It is non-synchronized.
High memory as it maintains the insertion order.
Slower than HashSet if elements are more.

TreeSet:
Maintains ascending order.
It does not allow null element.
It is non-synchronized.
It is slow.
Easy to find the smallest and largest elements.

SortedSet:
It is an interface that extends Set.
It maintains the elements in ascending order.

NavigableSet:
It is an interface that extends SortedSet.
It provides navigation methods like lower, floor, ceiling, higher etc.
It inherits the complexity of SortedSet.
