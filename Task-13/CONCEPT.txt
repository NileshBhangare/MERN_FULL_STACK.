Queue:

the FIFO approach i.e., First In First Out.

The queue is an abstract data type or linear data structure
from which elements can be inserted at the rear(back) of the queue
and elements can be deleted from the front(head) of the queue.

Deque:

 used to implement the functionalities of both Stack 
(LIFO approach i.e., Last In First Out) and Queue
 (FIFO approach i.e., First In First Out).

The double-ended queue is an abstract data type that generalizes
a queue from which elements can be inserted or deleted either
from both front(head) or rear(tail) ends.

There are two types of deque:

Input restricted deque:
output restricted deque:

Priority queue:

A priority queue is a type of queue that arranges elements based
 on their priority values. Elements with higher priority values
 are typically retrieved before elements with lower priority values.


Types of Priority Queue:

Ascending Order Priority Queue
Descending order Priority Queue 


ArrayDeque:

The ArrayDeque class in Java is an implementation of the Deque interface
that uses a resizable array to store its elements.
